# License

Libcubescript is provided to you under the terms of the zlib license, just
like the source it was originally derived from.

The software is originally based on the CubeScript implementation in the Cube 2
game/engine, which by now serves mostly as an inspiration, as the code has been
largely rewritten (though isolated bits of the original source may remain).

For copyright holders beyond just CubeScript, please refer to Cube 2's original
license file.

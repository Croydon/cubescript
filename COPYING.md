# Original copyright

The software is originally based on the CubeScript implementation in the Cube 2
game/engine, which by now serves mostly as an inspiration, as the code has been
largely rewritten (though isolated bits of the original source may remain); it
was provided under the zlib license and was:

Copyright (C) 2001-2015 Wouter "aardappel" van Oortmerssen and Lee "eihrul" Salzman

For copyright holders beyond just CubeScript, please refer to Cube 2's original
license file. Permission was given by the original copyright holders to re-license
the source code under the same license as the rest of OctaForge projects and this
note now serves to credit the original authors.

# Bundled source

Libcubescript bundles the linenoise line editing library for REPL usage.
This library is available under the BSD 2-clause license, which is available

 * is no longer safe to use the range.
 *
 * As it's an input range, it's not safe to use it with multipass algorithms.
 * If you do, expect strange semantics, as the state is shared between all
 * ranges over a single stream.
 *
 * The range caches the most recently read line. On a call to any method
 * that manipulates the range (empty(), front() or pop_front()) it will try
 * to read a line from the stream unless it already has one. The line will
 * therefore not be readable from the stream again (from another range for
 * example).
 *
 * The lines are read using ostd::stream::get_line().
 *
 * You can provide a custom type for characters, by default it's `char`.
 * It must be trivial.
 *
 * You can also provide a custom type used to hold the line, which must be a
 * container type over `T` which can append at the end. By default,
 * it's an std::basic_string over `T`.
 *
 * @tparam T The type used for individual characters.
 * @tparam TC The type used to hold the line (in an ostd::appender()).

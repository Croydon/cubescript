/** @brief A thread-safe message queue.
 *
 * A channel is a kind of message queue (FIFO) that is properly synchronized.
 * It can be used standalone or it can be used as a part of libostd's
 * concurrency system.
 *
 * It stores its internal state in a reference counted manner, so multiple
 * channel instances can reference the same internal state. The internal
 * state is freed as soon as the last channel instance referencing it is
 * destroyed.
 *
 * Channels are move constructible. Moving a channel transfers the state
 * into another channel and leaves the original state in an unusable
 * state, with no reference count change. Copying a channel increases
 * the reference count, so both instances point to the ssame state and
 * both are valid.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the values in the queue.
